# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting heart disease using a comprehensive analysis of the Heart Disease Dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Staglog Heart). The goal is to provide an interactive and user-friendly interface for data exploration, analysis, and prediction of heart disease based on patient data.

The project leverages R Shiny to create a web application that allows users to upload the dataset, visualize various analyses, and make predictions about whether a patient is likely to suffer from heart disease.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Heart Disease Dataset, which is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains various medical attributes related to heart health, such as age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, and more. The dataset is provided in a CSV format (heart.csv).

**Value Proposition:**
- Early detection of potential heart disease risks.
- User-friendly interface for non-technical users.
- Interactive data exploration and visualization.
- Accurate prediction models based on comprehensive data analysis.
